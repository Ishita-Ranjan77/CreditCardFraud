# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a heavily class-imbalanced credit card dataset using a combination of advanced data preprocessing, machine learning models, and performance optimization techniques.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - Near Miss Algorithm
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  - Combined Over- and Under-Sampling
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - 10-Fold Cross-Validation
  - GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Visualization:**
  - Utilized NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for efficient data handling and visualization, ensuring a robust foundation for model development.

- **Handling Class Imbalance:**
  - Applied Near Miss, SMOTE, and combined sampling techniques to balance the dataset, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to accurately detect fraudulent transactions.

- **Model Implementation:**
  - Engineered and implemented Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to classify transactions, tailored to the specific challenges posed by imbalanced data.

- **Model Optimization:**
  - Employed 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting, and used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Achieved AUPRC scores of 0.9996 for Decision Trees, 0.9992 for Random Forest, and 0.995 for K-Nearest Neighbors, demonstrating high precision and recall in fraud detection.
